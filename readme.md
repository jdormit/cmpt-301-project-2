# CMPT-301 Project 2 - Linear Models and Neural Networks
### Jeremy Dormitzer, Aspen Hopkins, Jerry Argyle and Alex Brown

## Goals
This project aims to:
- Read in data from the MNIST data set and the 20 News Groups dataset
- Use gradient descent to develop a classifier, and test it
- Use a 2-layer neural network to develop a classifier, and test it
- Display graphs representing the effectiveness of each classifier
